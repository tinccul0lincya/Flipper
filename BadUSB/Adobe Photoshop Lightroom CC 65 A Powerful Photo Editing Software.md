## How to Use Tone2 Gladiator 2 v2.5
 
Tone2 Gladiator 2 v2.5 is a very powerful and complex plugin that can create a variety of sounds, from classic analog to futuristic digital. To help you understand how it works, we will explain some of its main components and functions.
 
### The Oscillators
 
The oscillators are the sound generators of Tone2 Gladiator 2 v2.5. They use the HCM synthesis technology, which allows you to morph between different waveforms and create unique timbres. You can choose from over 40 oscillator types, such as analog, additive, FM, phase distortion, wavetable, sync, noise, and more. You can also load your own samples or waveforms into the oscillators.
 
You can use up to four oscillators per voice, and each oscillator has its own volume, pan, tune, phase, pulse width, and modulation controls. You can also use the oscillator mixer to blend the oscillators together and apply filters, distortion, ring modulation, frequency shifting, and more.
 
### The Filters
 
The filters are used to shape the sound of the oscillators by removing or boosting certain frequencies. Tone2 Gladiator 2 v2.5 has two filter sections, each with over 40 filter types, such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, comb, formant, vowel, EQ, and more. You can also use the filter feedback to create resonant effects.
 
Each filter section has its own cutoff, resonance, drive, key tracking, envelope amount, and modulation controls. You can also use the filter routing to change the order and connection of the filters.
 
### The Modulation
 
The modulation is used to add movement and variation to the sound by changing certain parameters over time. Tone2 Gladiator 2 v2.5 has a very flexible modulation system that lets you use various sources and targets for modulation. You can use up to six LFOs (low-frequency oscillators), four ADSR envelopes (attack-decay-sustain-release), four multi-stage envelopes (MSEGs), four step sequencers (SEQs), four modulators (MODs), and four modifiers (MODIFs) as modulation sources. You can also use external sources such as MIDI controllers or velocity.
 
You can assign any modulation source to any parameter by using the modulation matrix or by simply dragging and dropping the source onto the target. You can also adjust the amount and polarity of the modulation by using the knobs or sliders next to the target parameter.
 
### The Effects
 
The effects are used to enhance and embellish the sound by adding extra processing such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser
